    <div class="date">Posted August 25th, 2018</div>
    <div class="blog-text">While in my developmental psychology doctoral program, a Human Prenatal Development professor who also worked as a psychologist, suggested that she frequently treats parents who believed that temperament could not be changed. She asked me how parents and other caregivers might differ in their behavior toward infants and toddlers if they believe that temperament is largely unchangeable, as opposed to believing that temperament can be modified by experience.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        I responded that I think this is as simple as believing there is or is not something one can do about the situation. That is, a person could easily give in and just think: "well I am who I am and she or he is who they are, and we just cannot do anything about this." This is where teaching about concepts such as “love languages,” for example, can become helpful. We need to know what each member of a dyad responds to, needs, and wants, to act out of respect and acceptance. This way expectations or limits can become clear or be challenged or amended- as the case may be.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        I tend to believe though, that temperament is a fairly stable construct. However, I also believe in human adaptability and strength. Additionally, as we learn more about neurodivergence especially, I believe society's views of an ideal temperament can shift, or we can at least challenge beliefs and ideas to meet people where they are at without judgment. Specifically considering the goodness-of-fit model (Thomas & Chess, 1977), it is presumed that babies have unique temperaments that adults should accept and adapt to, rather than fight or respond poorly to. That is, it is up to the adult caregivers to adjust an environment to build on the child’s strengths and offer support, rather than exaggerate a child’s struggles. So while we cannot take all the credit as parents or blame ourselves for everything, it is largely up to us to not limit our children initially. What a task though. I am curious about what others think.

        <h4>Overexcitability- Is It A Thing?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect picture (or storm) of what makes gifted children so unique.</p>

            Birds of a feather flock together… true story. This is often why we have friends and spouses with a similar neurological aptitude. Have you found your tribe? Do you have a neuro tribe? A what? In the 1990s, autism advocate Judy Singer coined the phrase neurodiversity, and suggested it helped society understand that the ‘Neurologically Different’ such as those with ASD, ADHD, Tourette's, Dyslexia, Giftedness, etc., had experienced atypical (neurodivergent)</p>

            You are not the only mom who has been judged for being in public with a child who has a pervasive psychomotor OE, when she ran and jumped and yelled… a lot.
        You are not the only kid who thinks you cannot possibly make it through the school day because of your crippling anxiety, and you are not the only kid or adult who takes mental health days to deal with your intense emotions.
        You are not the only teacher being scolded by administration for keeping too much “junk” in your classroom, though your students do more than most would imagine.</p>
