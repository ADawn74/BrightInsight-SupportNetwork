        I was posed a question as follows:<p>&nbsp</p> 
        "Patty, given that Piaget suggests that thought develops from action, how do you think a child with physical limitations would be impacted by this? Do you think their physical limitations would impact their cognitive development?"<p>&nbsp</p>
        To this I answered (and I believe it with every inch of my being):<p>&nbsp</p>
        While I believe physical limitations would impact a child's cognitive development, I tend not to identify this impact as negative, but rather different. That is, while children of average intelligence with typical physical ability may develop certain cognitive strengths and abilities, those with differing abilities may in turn develop different strengths.<p>&nbsp</p>
        There is a concept I talk to parents and other individuals about called compensation, or gifted compensation, that explains this well. According to Silverman (2009), "Compensation is the mind’s ability to solve a problem in another way than is typical" (para.3). This ability is seen frequently in twice-exceptional (2e) individuals who are cognitively advanced, but also struggle with a disability. 2e individuals that is, might accommodate and compensate for their difficulties in a way that actually creates a more advanced or different ability through the process. This ability, similar to any child, involves assimilation and accommodation. The accommodation aspect is simply different for differently-abled individuals. <p>&nbsp</p>

        <h4>Overexcitability- Is It A Thing?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect pict</p>
