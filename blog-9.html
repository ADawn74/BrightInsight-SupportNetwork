    <h2 class="blog-title2">Dyslexic as the Day is Long</h2>
    <div class="date">Posted April 23, 2019</div>
    <div class="blog-text">I wrote a blog post about neurodiversity a couple of days ago. It was good, but there was a gleamingly obvious error… obvious that it, to everyone but me. When I was listing some examples of neurodiversity in the form of conditions such as ASD, ADHD, etc… I also listed turrets instead of Tourette’s. I listed a castle tower and didn’t have a clue because first- yay spell-check, and F.U. dyslexia.<p>&nbsp</p>
        I am 2e myself. That is, I have been identified as both gifted and learning disabled. The B.S. thing about this is that as a 40-something-year-old PhD student, I still believe I should not have problems because of my issues- everyone tells me as such. <p>&nbsp</p>
        - My boss reminds me to use spell check and proofread… I do.<br>
        - My professors point out spelling errors and tell me to be more careful… I am.<br>
        - My husband still tries to say left or right last minute while driving… yeah, that just does not work. <p>&nbsp</p>
        If we are to truly accept and appreciate neurodiversity, I need to accept myself even more. I need to forgive myself when after proofreading a blog a dozen times, I still miss the obvious and receive judgment and correction. And I need to continue speaking appreciation for those corrections. <p>&nbsp</p>
        The one person who pointed out my misspelling of Tourette’s…. THANK YOU! Really. <p>&nbsp</p>
        To everyone else who read the post and disregarded it because of the error, please read it again and consider me too as neurologically different and in need of compassion and understanding.<p>&nbsp</p>
        I am trying to do this for myself as well.<p>&nbsp</p>

            Blogging is a difficult thing to do at times. It is vulnerable. I used to feel more comfortable as I put myself in the position of expert. Now I feel far more exposed. The ups and downs of multilevel disintegration are hard.</p>

        <h4>Overexcitability- Is It A Thing?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect pict</p>
