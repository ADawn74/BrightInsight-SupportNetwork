<details>
        <summary>What is Gifted/Giftedness?</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Though gifted and giftedness are commonly used terms in education, the definition of giftedness can vary depending on the setting. The Columbus Group (1991) definition defines giftedness is: "asynchronous development in which advanced cognitive abilities and heightened intensity combine to create inner experiences and awareness that are qualitatively different from the norm. This asynchrony increases with higher intellectual capacity. The uniqueness of the gifted renders them particularly vulnerable and requires modifications in parenting, teaching, and counseling in order for them to develop optimally."<p>&nbsp</p>

        Patty and a group of informed and explorative professionals and laypersons are getting ready to work on this definition. Currently, Patty Williams, founder of BISN, is defining gifted persons as those with a highly above-average ability to acquire new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences through a process of rapid pattern-finding and meaning-making, which is often retained after one to two repetitions of exposure. Along with this rapid ability to learn, it is also noted that gifted persons tend to experience the world with great intensity or the blunting of intensity in sensual, psychomotor, imaginational, intellectual, and/or emotional domains, and develop in a way that is initially asynchronous.<p>&nbsp</p>

        To be considered gifted, individuals are ofted identified as gifted in grade school, by a psychologist, and/or by a gifted peer group. They could also have an IQ over 130 (this number varies depending on IQ test and measures) or be members of groups for gifted individuals such as Mensa, InterGifted, The Puttyverse, or otherwise. It is understood that many adults do not identify their own giftedness until they have gifted children of their own or gifted peers in adulthood (Kuipers, 2007; Milic & Simeunovic, 2020). Seeing themselves through their later identified children or peers is common and considered reliable in relation to earlier identification efforts (Kuipers, 2007; Milic & Simeunovic, 2020). Self-identification is also considered appropriate when evidenced in some appropriate or anecdotal manner.

    <summary>What is meant by Learning Difference/Learning Disability/Disability or Second Exceptionality?</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The National Institute of Health’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (n.d.) specifically states that “Learning disabilities are disorders that affect the ability to understand or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention,” (Definition, para.2). Examples of a learning disability may include dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, apraxia of speech, central auditory processing disorder, nonverbal learning disorders, and more (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2018). Due to the nature of the construct and issues with under-identification, a person can self-identify as having a learning disorder if they believe or have been known to have a learning disability or impairment. This definition is consistent with Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 1630.2, item g (29 C.F.R. § 1630.2[g]), where it is recognized that a person is identified as having a disability if they present with, is regarded as, or has a record of physical or mental impairment seen as substantially limiting a single or multiple major life activities (National Archives, 2011). Second exceptionalities though can relate to other differences depending on others' lived experiences (more about this under twice-exceptional).

    <summary>What is Twice-Exceptionality (2e)?</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Linda Silverman (2009), a long-time contributor to the field of gifted education, therapy, and twice-exceptionality, reported in her hallmark article about gifted compensation that the identification of twice-exceptionality distinguishes those who have both accelerated ability and learning struggles. Reis et al. (2014) rather considered a more operational outlining of this term, using the Joint Commission on Twice Exceptionality’s definition that identified 2e persons as those who display high-potential and exceptional talent, along with social, attention, and learning adversities, placing them at an identified risk of social-emotional difficulties and underachievement without early, professional intervention. Reis et al. further suggested that this risk to 2e persons can be mitigated by important leaders and professionals who remain consistently aware of and responsive to needs related to twice-exceptionality. There is no clinical definition for twice-exceptionality in the DSM-V or other diagnostic manuals.

    <summary>What is meant by Neurodiversity, Neurodivergence, Neurodivergent (ND), and Neurotypical (NT)?</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        According to Judy Singer who developed the term, Neurodiversity is a feature of Earth as a whole, that refers to the limitless variability of human cognition and the uniqueness of each human mind. It is a political term to argue for the importance of including all neurotypes for a thriving human society. Neurodivergence then or being Neurodivergent is simply a difference in how the brain works that is qualitatively and even measurably from the norm or those who are Neurotypical. Society and practitioners are starting to shift to no longer treating neurodivergence as an illness, but rather as a different method of learning and processing information such as is seen with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, bipolar, and so on (this is a very large umbrella).

    <summary>What is Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration?</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Kazimierz Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration is a theory of personality development. It proposes that individuals can experience psychological growth and reach higher developmental levels through a process of disintegration and subsequent reintegration.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
According to Dabrowski, individuals who are sensitive, creative, and sometimes even idealistic experience a state of inner tension between their current level of development and their potential for growth. This tension can lead to a process of disintegration, where the individual experiences inner conflict, emotional turmoil, and a sense of existential crisis.
<p>&nbsp</p>
However, if the individual can successfully navigate this process of disintegration, they can emerge at a higher level of psychological functioning, with greater autonomy, empathy, and moral sensitivity. This process of positive disintegration is seen as a natural and necessary part of the growth towards self-actualization and personal fulfillment.
<p>&nbsp</p>
Overall, Dabrowski's theory emphasizes the importance of embracing one's inner conflict and using it as a catalyst for growth and personal development, rather than suppressing or avoiding it.

    <summary>What are Overexcitabilities (OEs)?</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a Polish psychologist (see Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration), identified five innate intensities or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted persons. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect picture (or storm) of what makes gifted children so unique.<br><a href="https://www.gifteddevelopment.org/musings/newinsights">Read More Here</a>
