        <div class="title">President and Co-Founder</div></div>

    <div class="bio-r">Bright Insight co-founder and current president, Patty Williams, MSMHC, PhD, is a trauma therapist who specializes in EMDR, ND-affirming DBT, and IFS modalities. Through Bright Insight Support Network, she honors the whole person(s) while working to counsel, coach, and advocate for gifted, twice-exceptional (2e), and neurodivergent (ND) persons, along with other marginalized populations. Her unique involvement with this community gives her a platform through which Patty writes, presents, and educates others about giftedness, twice-exceptionality, neurodiversity, trauma, relationships, parenting, leadership, and developmental psychology. As a 2e adult, Patty is no stranger to topics impacting gifted, 2e and neurodivergent persons. She makes it her personal mission to connect with others, authentically.
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        Outside of her work as a therapist and advocate, Patty teaches Student Connections for Success at Cochise College in Sierra Vista, Arizona. She is also on the California BrainWaves neuroscience advisory board as a 2e specialist and she is the Cochise County area coordinator for Free Mom Hugs- Arizona, a group of parents, friends, and allies who support the LGBTQIA+ community. Additionally, Patty is a mother to two adult daughters, wife of a disabled veteran husband of many years, and rescue farmer at New Day Farmstead, a 5-acre farm with goats, sheep, ducks, a mini donkey, geese, chickens, turkeys, pigs, dogs, a garage cat, a foster tortoise, a handful of Jeeps, and several tractors.</div>

He’s a quick study, a systems thinker with an investigative and creatively divergent mind. His career-defining mission is to “make the important interesting.” His years of experience on the street as a local newspaper reporter in the Pacific Northwest shaped his natural curiosity and insight, sparking his drive to push for a more equitable society.<p>&nbsp</p> 
        
        Today, Youssef facilitates virtual get-togethers with gifted individuals, actively follows the gifted community and serves as a network moderator for a gifted/2E group. Exceptionally gifted himself without a second exceptionality, Youssef devotes his time in the gifted community promoting mental health while supporting and empathizing with humanity’s outliers. <p>&nbsp</p> 
        
        When he’s not replacing keyboards ruined by his typing speed, he entertains himself with novel writing, collaborative storygaming and trying new hobbies.

    <div class="bio-r">Software engineer, creative writer, comparative religion devotee, historian, world traveler and native Bostonian —  Andrew Goldish loves to make connections. Once a socially awkward math prodigy, Andrew is a polymath with a degree from MIT in theoretical computer science and a minor in planetary sciences. Inspired by the camaraderie at MIT, he networks today with Boston Athenaeum, Third Factor, and the Harvard Club.
