        <h3>Confidence and Humility</h3>
        <p class="p-card">
            Blogging is a difficult thing to do at times. It is vulnerable. I used to feel more comfortable as I put myself in the position of expert. Now I feel far more exposed. The ups and downs of multilevel disintegration are hard.  I’ve found myself there, again.The waning and waxing of confidence versus humility,

        <h3>Overexcitability- Is It A Thing?</h3>
        <p class="p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect picture (or storm) of what makes gifted children so unique. </p>

        <p class="p-card">
            My Human Prenatal Development professor, who works as a psychologist, suggested that she frequently treats parents who believe that temperament cannot be changed, and asked me how parents and other caregivers might differ in their behavior toward infants and toddlers if they believe that temperament is largely unchangeable, as opposed to believing that temperament can be modified by experience.</p>

        <p class="p-card">
            Birds of a feather flock together… true story. This is often why we have friends and spouses with a similar neurological aptitude. Have you found your tribe? Do you have a neuro tribe? A what? In the 1990s, autism advocate Judy Singer coined the phrase neurodiversity, and suggested it helped society understand that the ‘Neurologically Different’ such as those with ASD, ADHD, Tourette's, Dyslexia, Giftedness, etc., had experienced atypical (neurodivergent)</p>

            You are not the only mom who has been judged for being in public with a child who has a pervasive psychomotor OE, when she ran and jumped and yelled… a lot.
        You are not the only kid who thinks you cannot possibly make it through the school day because of your crippling anxiety, and you are not the only kid or adult who takes mental health days to deal with your intense emotions.
        You are not the only teacher being scolded by administration for keeping too much “junk” in your classroom, though your students do more than most would imagine.</p>

        <h3>Bright Insight… What is this all about?</h3>
        <p class="p-card">
            Bright Insight is the brain child of best friends who saw a deficit in their children’s lives, and in their community and society.
            The problem is multi-faceted, but begins with a lack of understanding for what giftedness is. For many, gifted children are identified as “the smart kids” in school, often the nerds, and often an elite crowd.</p>
