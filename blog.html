        <p class="p-card">
            I have had vivid dreams all my life. I write them down when I can. I used to be compelled to write them down, but my psychomotor overexcitability (OE) has diminished over time. Still, my dreams tell me what I'm thinking, that I don't know that I'm thinking, and they are a motor to drive me.

        <p class="p-card">
            I've long said about work with gifted kids that "a fire needs a fireplace." When an intense soul mixes with a wild mind, it needs a grounded, stable, safe place to be warmly reminded of the shared reality. Empathy can be that fireplace. Stay present and listen for feelings and the universal human needs they point to.

            I am five chapters in… FIVE CHAPTERS IN… to my book about giftedness and trauma. I finished a dissertation and plenty of poems… even a couple of short stories… but never a book.<br> Why this book? Why am I writing THIS book, why does it matter, and how am I able to potentially finish it when other attempts to finish books failed? Well, I suppose a big part of it is that I am a trauma therapist who is also a gifted person with a trauma history. And maybe I am getting over impostor syndrome now that I have some weighty letters after my name.

            I had always heard in the past about gifted individuals. I never would have thought I was one of them. The more I learn about giftedness, the more I see how I tend to find I align with many qualities.
            I was 31 years old when I found out I was gifted. This is a newfound awareness for me. I have a very close friend that told me I was gifted. I remember thinking:

        <p class="p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect picture (or storm) of what makes gifted children so unique. </p>

            I was posed a question as follows:
        "Patty, given that Piaget suggests that thought develops from action, how do you think a child with physical limitations would be impacted by this? Do you think their physical limitations would impact their cognitive development?"
        To this I answered (and I believe it with every inch of my being):</p>

            Bright Insight is the brain child of best friends who saw a deficit in their children’s lives, and in their community and society.
            The problem is multi-faceted, but begins with a lack of understanding for what giftedness is. For many, gifted children are identified as “the smart kids” in school, often the nerds, and often an elite crowd.</p>
