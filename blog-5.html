    <div class="blog-text">You are not the only mom who has been judged for being in public with a child who has a pervasive psychomotor OE, when she ran and jumped and yelled… a lot.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        You are not the only kid who thinks you cannot possibly make it through the school day because of your crippling anxiety, and you are not the only kid or adult who takes mental health days to deal with your intense emotions.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        You are not the only teacher being scolded by administration for keeping too much “junk” in your classroom, though your students do more than most would imagine.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        You are not the only child (or adult) who has to turn their socks inside-out, wear unconventional footwear, or chew on a necklace.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        You are not the only dad who has to ask your kid five times to take out the trash because he got sidetracked by the books about Egyptology piled on the floor next to his bed. And on his desk. And in the bathroom. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        You are not the only friend who curled up next to your bestie because she finally decided it was OK to cry about all of it, realizing this was a breakthrough and not just a meltdown. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        You are not alone.
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        If you are not OK, that is OK. You are not alone in this either.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        Lets figure out OK together.

        <h4>Neurodiversity</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Birds of a feather flock together… true story. This is often why we have friends and spouses with a similar neurological aptitude. Have you found your tribe? Do you have a neuro tribe? A what? In the 1990s, autism advocate Judy Singer coined the phrase neurodiversity, and suggested it helped society understand that the ‘Neurologically Different’ such as those with ASD, ADHD, Tourette's, Dyslexia, Giftedness, etc., had experienced atypical (neurodivergent)</p>

        <h4>Bright Insight… What is this all about?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Bright Insight is the brain child of best friends who saw a deficit in their children’s lives, and in their community and society.
            The problem is multi-faceted, but begins with a lack of understanding for what giftedness is. For many, gifted children are identified as “the smart kids” in school, often the nerds, and often an elite crowd.</p>

            Blogging is a difficult thing to do at times. It is vulnerable. I used to feel more comfortable as I put myself in the position of expert. Now I feel far more exposed. The ups and downs of multilevel disintegration are hard.</p>
