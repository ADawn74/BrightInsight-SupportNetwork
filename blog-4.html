    <h2 class="blog-title2">Neurodiversity</h2>
    <div class="date">Posted April 21st, 2018</div>
    <div class="blog-text">Birds of a feather flock together… true story. This is often why we have friends and partners with similar neurological aptitudes. Have you found your people? Do you have a safe space where you can be your fully neurodivergent self?
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        Your what?
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        In the 1990s, Autism advocate Judy Singer coined the word "neurodiversity" and suggested it helped society understand that the neurologically different, such as those with Autism, ADHD, Tourette's, Dyslexia, Giftedness, etc., had experienced atypical (neurodivergent) neurological development and a qualitatively different-than-typical existence. This divergence, per Singer and the Neurodiversity Movement, is a normal human difference that should be recognized and respected as any other human variation. Singer also believed that neurodiversity should not be first seen as problematic or pathological, since it is simply an alternate and acceptable form of the human experience.
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        I agree. But so what?
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        Why do we care (so much) about neurodiversity? For me, I see it as a difference that often prompts discrimination, angst, and misunderstanding, but is not readily acknowledged because it is not easily seen. It is also not readily accepted in society and is often even demonized or corrected with medications, glares of disapproval, or suggestions that one should simply try harder to conform.
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        Yeah- just try harder to not be who you are, please (gross).
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        We attempt to adjust and accept as a society when it comes to diversity concerning race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., and we should, but we are slow to accept those who think, process, and even behave differently than the majority. What should we do about this then, if anything?
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        Should we be more accepting of all diversity?
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        Are there limitations?
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        Is it OK that we simply prescribe ABA for Autistic kiddos, methylphenidate for our ADHD folks, or suggest “well their grades are fine so they don’t need services” for our gifted and 2E students?
        <p>&nbsp</p> 
        What do you think? Tell me about your experiences with and thoughts about neurodiversity. I would LOVE to know!

            My Human Prenatal Development professor, who works as a psychologist, suggested that she frequently treats parents who believe that temperament cannot be changed, and asked me how parents and other caregivers might differ in their behavior toward infants and toddlers if they believe that temperament is largely unchangeable, as opposed to believing that temperament can be modified by experience.</p>

            You are not the only mom who has been judged for being in public with a child who has a pervasive psychomotor OE, when she ran and jumped and yelled… a lot.
            You are not the only kid who thinks you cannot possibly make it through the school day because of your crippling anxiety, and you are not the only kid or adult who takes mental health days to deal with your intense emotions.
            You are not the only teacher being scolded by administration for keeping too much “junk” in your classroom, though your students do more than most would imagine.</p>

        <h4>Bright Insight… What is this all about?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Bright Insight is the brain child of best friends who saw a deficit in their children’s lives, and in their community and society.
            The problem is multi-faceted, but begins with a lack of understanding for what giftedness is. For many, gifted children are identified as “the smart kids” in school, often the nerds, and often an elite crowd.</p>
