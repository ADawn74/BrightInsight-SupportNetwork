    <h2 class="blog-title2">Finding out I’m Gifted </h2>
    <div class="date">Posted May 30, 2023</div>
    <div class="blog-text">I had always heard in the past about gifted individuals. I never would have thought <em>I</em> was one of <em>them</em>. The more I learn about giftedness, the more I see how I tend to find I align with many qualities. <p>&nbsp</p> 
        I was 31 years old when I found out I was gifted. This is a newfound awareness for me. I have a very close friend that told me I was gifted. I remember thinking: <em>Who? Me? No way!</em> In the past, when I thought of “gifted” I thought of people who had high IQs or were easily smart without applying themselves. At the time of the conversation, I didn’t think that was me. <p>&nbsp</p> 
        Now I am realizing that I do fall into the category of learning in 2 repetitions. I never really thought that made me special until I started thinking back on all the times I’ve trained people at work. The number of times I would have to show them the same thing for them to understand the task versus 1 or 2 for myself. <p>&nbsp</p> 
        It finally clicked. <p>&nbsp</p> 
        I don’t know if I am 2e because although I have dyslexia and possibly other neurological differences, I’m not sure it is enough to qualify as 2e. It is not enough to be a difficulty or disorder. I am dyslexic but not enough that I cannot type or write. It pops up here and there but not all the time.  <p>&nbsp</p> 
        I am still very early in my learning about 2e and gifted individuals. I am sure I will continue to learn in other ways that I fit into the gifted community. <p>&nbsp</p> 
        Very excited to be part of this awesome group of extremely cool people. I look forward to writing more blog posts and continuing to learn about giftedness and twice exceptionality.

        You are not the only mom who has been judged for being in public with a child who has a pervasive psychomotor OE, when she ran and jumped and yelled… a lot.
        You are not the only kid who thinks you cannot possibly make it through the school day because of your crippling anxiety, and you are not the only kid or adult who takes mental health days to deal with your intense emotions.

            Blogging is a difficult thing to do at times. It is vulnerable. I used to feel more comfortable as I put myself in the position of expert. Now I feel far more exposed. The ups and downs of multilevel disintegration are hard.</p>

        <h4>Overexcitability- Is It A Thing?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect pict</p>
