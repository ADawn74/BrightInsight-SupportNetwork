    <h2 class="blog-title2">Overecitability- Is It A Thing?</h2>
    <div class="date">Posted November 12th, 2018</div>
    <div class="blog-text">Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect picture (or storm) of what makes gifted children so unique. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        It was identified recently, at Bright Insight’s November 2018 BITT, that these labels can be misleading. Intellectual over-excitability however, while sometimes strange (the kid who knows the scientific name for every type of meteorite), can be more socially acceptable. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        But… I must admit, I tend not to like the label of over-excitability or even intensity, because of the attached negative connotation. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        When a child breaks down in tears because she cannot get a hair bow strait above her ponytail (emotional and sensual OE), saying this is due to an over-excitability may cause us to also say she is overly sensitive or a picky perfectionist. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        When a young man will not stop tapping his foot in class and makes airplane noises (psychomotor and imaginational OEs), saying this is due to over-excitability may cause us to also say he is hyperactive, distracting, and lacks self-control. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        Even titling these as super-sensitivities or intensities can be misleading, as it suggests these children are overly sensitive or intense. Granted, gifted individuals may be just that, but how does the world interpret this? 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        Maybe it is time to reframe. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        My thought is this: Instead of over-excitability, why not call this elevated-ability, or even intrinsic asynchronicity, as suggested by Maggie Pinney? 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        What if that little girl with the bow had an elevated ability to sense a lack of balance and a profound aesthetic awareness that causes her to struggle with frustration tolerance? 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        What if that young man was using his intrinsic pull toward movement, vocalization, and interest in airplanes to calm anxiety and focus, in place of otherwise absent skills? 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        I would say these children are in need of support and compassion, just like any human being. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        What are your thoughts? Is it time to reframe OEs? Do you have a more positive reframe?

            Blogging is a difficult thing to do at times. It is vulnerable. I used to feel more comfortable as I put myself in the position of expert. Now I feel far more exposed. The ups and downs of multilevel disintegration are hard.</p>

            My Human Prenatal Development professor, who works as a psychologist, suggested that she frequently treats parents who believe that temperament cannot be changed, and asked me how parents and other caregivers might differ in their behavior toward infants and toddlers if they believe that temperament is largely unchangeable, as opposed to believing that temperament can be modified by experience.</p>

            Birds of a feather flock together… true story. This is often why we have friends and spouses with a similar neurological aptitude. Have you found your tribe? Do you have a neuro tribe? A what? In the 1990s, autism advocate Judy Singer coined the phrase neurodiversity, and suggested it helped society understand that the ‘Neurologically Different’ such as those with ASD, ADHD, Tourette's, Dyslexia, Giftedness, etc., had experienced atypical (neurodivergent)</p>
