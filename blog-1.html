    <h2 class="blog-title2"> Confidence and Humility</h2>
    <div class="blog-text">Blogging is a difficult thing to do at times. It is vulnerable. I used to feel more comfortable as I put myself in the position of expert. Now I feel far more exposed. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        The ups and downs of multilevel disintegration are hard. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        I’ve found myself there, again. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        The waning and waxing of confidence versus humility, 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        When actually they exist as compliments- each of the other.
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        It is exhausting. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>  
        What makes me an expert on anything? This is an odd question as I know I have a lot to teach. I could argue why I know what I do, however, this is also seemingly subjective. Are you not also an expert?
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        The way I run Bright Insight Table Talks (BITTs) assumes all who participate have some pocket of expertise and wisdom to share. This is why I am not a presenter at BITTs and do not vet participation. Every person who is interested in attending has something to bring to the table. When there are say ten of us, you have ten experts of their own experiences to learn from and your own expertise to offer. This also extends to participants, therefore, multiple opportunities to learn. 
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        In relation to giftedness and the gifted community, I see a great error, however. Often, we make the mistake of thinking we know more or better than our neurotypical peers. However, we forget that a person’s experience brings with it value and that since their experience and learning are not my own, they will be qualitatively (and quantitatively) different than my own. Because of this, every person has knowledge I do not have. I can learn from anyone. The moment I think I cannot is the moment I completely limit my development.

        <h4>Overexcitability- Is It A Thing?</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980), a polish psychologist, identified five intense behaviors or "over-excitabilities" (OEs) that are often displayed by gifted children. These intensities include psychomotor, sensual, emotional, intellectual, and imaginational types. And while one of these OEs may be dominant, they are often combined to form a perfect picture (or storm) of what makes gifted children so unique. </p>

        <h4>Goodness of Fit</h4>
        <p class="sm-p-card">
            My Human Prenatal Development professor, who works as a psychologist, suggested that she frequently treats parents who believe that temperament cannot be changed, and asked me how parents and other caregivers might differ in their behavior toward infants and toddlers if they believe that temperament is largely unchangeable, as opposed to believing that temperament can be modified by experience.</p>

            Birds of a feather flock together… true story. This is often why we have friends and spouses with a similar neurological aptitude. Have you found your tribe? Do you have a neuro tribe? A what? In the 1990s, autism advocate Judy Singer coined the phrase neurodiversity, and suggested it helped society understand that the ‘Neurologically Different’ such as those with ASD, ADHD, Tourette's, Dyslexia, Giftedness, etc., had experienced atypical (neurodivergent)</p>
